# Overall instructions, in this script. Model the life of a tree.
# 1. Pass growing seasons until a tree is mature.
#   For each growing season, print out the age and height of a tree.  
# 2. When a tree is mature, print "Tree matured"
# 3. For each season a tree is mature, pass growing seasons. For each growing season, print out the age, height, and oranges for each season.
# 4. Refactor your orange tree class into saplings. When creating a new orange tree, pass in both an age and height.
# 5. Create a parent class, Fruit Tree. Move the properties from orange tree to fruit tree that make sense. Orange Tree should inheret from Fruit Tree.
# 6. For each of the growing seasons above, harvest oranges into an array. 
#   Also print the total diameters and average diameter for all oranges picked.
